            <h1>Top Watefalls in Sri Lanka</h1>

            <p>Sri Lanka, in comparison to its size, has perhaps the largest number of waterfalls of any country in the world. Indeed, there are over 400 recorded waterfalls in Sri Lanka. LCWF was the first organization to put an consolidated effort to develop
                an complete list of waterfalls of Sri Lanka. They created a database of 382 waterfalls in the country. This list based on the LCWF database but has been expanded by further 48 waterfalls making the total 430 waterfalls.Sri Lanka is a country
                with a lot of waterfalls. There are over 400 on the entire island. Some have natural pools to bathe in, while others are more rugged and can only be seen from a distance. Here’s a list of the most stunning waterfalls in Sri Lanka.</p>

            <h1>1. Baker's Fall</h1>
            <img src="images/waterfall1.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The Baker’s Falls in the Horton Plains gets its water from the Belihul Oya. It is close to World’s End. The icy waters glisten in the sunshine amid a backdrop of mountain terrain and deep valleys and the patna through which you traverse give
                it contrast. If you are lucky you may see the rare black monkey and rhododendrons in bloom. Discovered by Sir Samuel Baker and a good stopover on your way to the World’s end.</p>

            <h1>2. Bambarakanda Waterfall</h1>
            <img src="images/Waterfall2.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Sri Lanka is blessed with over one hundred waterfalls. The tallest is the Bambarakande Falls which cascades down 263 metres like liquid light. It is only four miles away from the Colombo-Bandarawela road in a forest glade, but it is not visited
                often, though well worth the trip. Bambarakanda is taller than the famous Diyaluma falls which is only 220 metres but thought to be the tallest waterfall in Sri Lanka. The Diyaluma or Diya Haluma collects its water from the Poonagala Oya
                in the vicinity of Koslanda and Wellawaya.

            <h1>3. Bopath Ella Waterfall </h1>
            <img src="images/waterfall3.jpg" alt="">
            <p>“Bopath Ella”, not like many of the others of her kind , finds her abode in a busy surrounding in the village called Devipahala off Kuruwita on A4 High Level road close to Ratnapura. Being within 3 hours driving distance from the capital,
                it thus claims the honour of having the highest turn-over of enthusiasts seeking respite from the grimy and monotonous town life .Nevertheless, it has the notorious reputation of devouring its visitors off and on who , attracted by the
                surroundings ,indulge in over-enjoyment .Here again, the falls take the shape of a “Bo” leave.</p>

            <h1>4. Devon Waterfall</h1>
            <img src="images/waterfall4.jpg" alt="">
            <p>With a peculiar appearance imparted to it by its formation in three continuous cascades this waterfall christened “Devon Falls” pours down to the valley beneath not a long distance away from its brother the “St. Clairs”. On the main road opposite
                to it there is situated a modern tea centre finding its abode thankful to this “Veil ( Bridal ) of the Vale ( i.e. valley )”. Driving from Colombo, the capital, via Avissawella one suddenly catches this unearthly sight which is to be soon
                enhanced by the grandeur of the “St. Clairs”. This beauty too is endangered by the above-mentioned power plant beast</p>
