            <h1>Top Five Mountains in Sri Lanka</h1>

            <p>The Central Hills of Sri Lanka have, for centuries, captured the imagination of travellers from around the island and across the world. From ancient explorers like the celebrated middle-Eastern globetrotter Ibn Battuta and Chinese monk Faxian
                to modern day hikers and thrill seekers looking for that rush of dopamine that only scaling a foreboding mountain can bring, the mountains of Sri Lanka have always been a source of grit and inspiration. Here, we have rounded up the best
                and most challenging of the lot for the Edmund Hillary in you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="beach1">
            <h1>1. Adam's Peak</h1>
            <img src="images/mountain1.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Undoubtedly the best known and most frequently climbed peak of them all. No list of Sri Lankan mountains is complete without this venerated and most sacred of hills located 40km northeast of Ratnapura (which literally translates to Gem City).
                At a staggering 2,243 metres above sea level, Adam’s Peak is the country’s fourth highest mountain, and its uniquely conical shape can be spotted from as far away as suburban Colombo and, on a clear day, in such unlikely places as Kalutara
                and even Bentota. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="beach2">
            <h1>2. Lakgala</h1>
            <img src="images/mountain2.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Lakegala (meaning Rock of Lanka) is accessible through the serene and highly isolated village of Meemure (worth a trip just for the amazing polos curry here) and is, by all accounts, the most difficult of all climbs you can undertake in Sri
                Lanka. Once you get past the wooded terrain at the base of the mountain, which can take hours depending on what trail you take, reaching the summit actually requires the use of rope and/or climbing gear. So yeah, it’s definitely not for
                the faint of heart; but absolutely worth the effort and risk, just to be able to say you’ve done it, if not for anything else. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="beach3">
            <h1>3. Kirigalpoththa</h1>
            <img src="images/mountain3.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Located in the heart of the picturesque Horton Plains, Kirigalpoththa rises a stupendous 2,388 metres above sea level. Don’t let this dissuade you, though. As the Horton Plains plateau itself is about 2,100 metres above sea level, the elevation
                gain of peak is just a few hundred metres. The climb is not particularly strenuous, but bad weather (and weather at Horton Plains is unpredictable, at best) can slow you down considerably on the way to the top and dampen your spirits somewhat.
                But the killer view that awaits you at the top more than makes up for it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="beach4">
            <h1>4. Alagalla</h1>
            <img src="images/mountain4.png" alt="">
            <p>This one is ideal for a one day trip. If you take the train to Kandy and get off at the Ihala Kotte railway station, the foot of the Alagalla hill and the beginning of the trail is literally across the track.There’s a couple of villages along
                the path (we visited about five years ago, so my memory is a bit sketchy on their names) and from there onwards (beyond a tea estate or two), it’s nothing but an uphill climb, through a handful of dense forest cover and grassy plains alike.
                As with any climb, dehydration can occur, so be sure to carry enough water on you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="beach5">
            <h1>5. Knuckels</h1>
            <img src="images/mountain5.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Hidden deep inside the range are some of the most isolated villages you’ll find anywhere in the island (such as Meemure mentioned above). Extremely traditional and far removed from industry, technology and any real concept of modernity, life
                in these villages couldn’t be more different from what urban dwellers, or even the most provincial of Sri Lankans, are accustomed to. Please note that this is not to say that people living in these areas are backward or uncivilised.</p>
