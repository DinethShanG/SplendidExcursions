            <h1>Top Sanctuaries in Sri Lanka</h1>

            <p>Sri Lanka Wildlife Sanctuaries is one of the finest wildlife watching countries in South Asia. The island may be small in size, but the variety of habitats, and the wildlife found there, would do justice to a country many times its size. A
                lot of nature reserves and sanctuaries are in Sri Lanka in order to protect the wildlife from human interests that might harm the animals including poaching. Visitors are allowed in to these reserves where you can take safari trips with
                a trained guide provided by the reserves themselves.</p>

            <h1>1. Yala National Park</h1>
            <img src="images/sanctuary1.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Yala National Park is the most visited and second largest national park in Sri Lanka. The park consists of five blocks, two of which are now open to the public, and also adjoining parks. The blocks have individual names such as, Ruhuna National
                Park (block 1) and Kumana National Park or ‘Yala East’ for the adjoining area. It is situated in the southeast region of the country, and lies in Southern Province and Uva Province. The park covers 979 square kilometres (378 sq mi) and
                is located about 300 kilometres (190 mi) from Colombo. Yala was designated as a wildlife sanctuary in 1900. </p>

            <h1>2. Wilpaththu National Park</h1>
            <img src="images/sanctuary2.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Wilpattu National Park (Willu-pattu; Land of Lakes) is a park located on the island of Sri Lanka. The unique feature of this park is the existence of “Willus” (Natural lakes) – Natural, sand-rimmed water basins or depressions that fill with
                rainwater. Located in the Northwest coast lowland dry zone of Sri Lanka. The park is located 30 km west Anuradhapura and located 26 km north of Puttalam (approximately 180 km north of Colombo). The park is 1,317 square kilometers (131,
                693 hectares) and ranges from 0 to 152 meters above sea level. Nearly sixty lakes (Willu) and tanks are found spread throughout Wilpattu. </p>

            <h1>3. Udawalawe National Park </h1>
            <img src="images/sanctuary3.jpg" alt="">
            <p>dawalawe National Park lies on the boundary of Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces, in Sri Lanka. The national park was created to provide a sanctuary for wild animals displaced by the construction of the Udawalawe Reservoir on the Walawe River,
                as well as to protect the catchment of the reservoir. The reserve covers 30,821 hectares (119.00 sq mi) of land area and was established on 30 June 1972. Before the designation of the national park, the area was used for shifting cultivation
                (chena farming). The farmers were gradually removed once the national park was declared. </p>

            <h1>4. Minneriya National Park</h1>
            <img src="images//sanctuary5.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Minneriya National Park is a national park in North Central Province of Sri Lanka. The area was designated as a national park on 12 August 1997, having been originally declared as a wildlife sanctuary in 1938. The reason for declaring the
                area as protected is to protect the catchment of Minneriya tank and the wildlife of the surrounding area. The tank is of historical importance, having been built by King Mahasen in third century AD. The park is a dry season feeding ground
                for the elephant population dwelling in forests of Matale, Polonnaruwa, and Trincomalee districts. </p>
