                    <p>buses, three-wheelers, trains and private transport modes like self-driven cars, vans, motorbikes or lorries make up the major transportation modes in Sri Lanka within the country. So we can say that transportation in Sri Lanka is
                        mainly based on the road network but airports, harbors, and waterways are also there.</p>

                    <h1>Rain Forest</h1>
                    <p>Rainforests are incredible places which cover only 6% of the surface area of the Earth, however more than half of the world’s plant and animal species lives in them. The reason they are called rainforests is because they receive a
                        high amount of rainfall annually. Consisting of tall, dense jungle, the climate inside a rainforest is hot and humid. At one time in Sri Lanka rainforests consisted of over 26% of the land area, however today only 2% is left of
                        forest cover. Hence it is no surprise that all rainforests in the island have been declared protected areas with Sinharaja designated as a World Heritage site.</p>

                    <h1>Hill Country</h1>
                    <p>Sri Lanka's Hill Country is the island at its most scenic, a mist-wrapped land of emerald peaks and stupendous views, of hillsides carpeted with tea plantations and graced by astonishing waterfalls. This is a place where you can wear
                        a fleece in the daytime and cuddle up beside a log fire in the evening. Where you can enjoy a memorable meal in the eternal city of Kandy or at a roadside shack in lovely Ella. A region where you can walk to the end of the world,
                        stand in the footsteps of the Buddha and be surrounded by a hundred wild elephants. Ride a train utterly bewitched by the vistas. Paddle a raft down a raging river. Enjoy the drumbeat of traditional dance and then savour the silence
                        on a lonely mountaintop.</p>

                    <p>
                        Sri Lanka Wildlife Sanctuaries is one of the finest wildlife watching countries in South Asia. The island may be small in size, but the variety of habitats, and the wildlife found there, would do justice to a country many times its size. A lot of nature
                        reserves and sanctuaries are in Sri Lanka in order to protect the wildlife from human interests that might harm the animals including poaching. Visitors are allowed in to these reserves where you can take safari trips with a trained
                        guide provided by the reserves themselves.Sri Lanka’s wildlife is as varied as the island itself, ranging from elephants and leopards to marine life and a vast number of different birds, and Sri Lanka is now one of the best places
                        in the world to see whales, including the mighty blue whale. With 12% of the country designated for wildlife protection, it is easy to get a taste of Sri Lankan wildlife</p>

                    <h1>Waterfalls</h1>
                    <p>The country is home to more than 100 waterfalls and rivers which at the end of the day stops at the Indian Ocean. Waterfalls are mostly located in the Hill Country. Some of the waterfalls are man-made but still doesn't stop short of
                        being breath-takingly beautiful. Unknown waterfalls are still present, those that weren't officially discovered. Most of the waterfalls are very difficult to find because of the dense forests and are sometimes totally inaccessible.
                        Only a handfull of waterfalls are used to bathe in, whereas the others are too dangerous to do so.This island is abundant with waterfalls which are known in the world over for their beauty and some of which are seasonal. If you
                        are looking to visit a waterfall during your next trip, here are 5 unique waterfalls that will leave you breathless.</p>

                    <p>Sri Lanka, the pearl of the Indian Ocean, has always been subject to conquest by various invaders. Apart from British colonization, this little island had previously been dominated by the Portuguese, Dutch, South Indians, etc., giving
                        Sri Lanka a wealth of history to boast about. This rich history makes Sri Lanka a tourist hotspot famous for its ancient ruins, age old buildings, legends and folktales. A trip to Sri Lanka wouldn’t be complete without a taste
                        of its history and a visit to these historical places in Sri Lanka. Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Sigiriya and Kandy form the cultural triangle and are home to most of the ancient ruins of Sri Lanka.</p>

                    <p>Sri Lanka’s Cultural and Religious sites are many. They range from the ancient ruins of cities, temples and shrines in the Cultural Triangle including the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy to the remains of Portuguese, Dutch and British
                        colonisation in the form of old forts (especially the one at Galle). In Colombo there are statues of cultural interest as well as modern monuments such as Independence Square. Colombo has many museums reflecting the importance
                        of its cultural heritage, including the National Museum with many artefacts from the Kandyan period. </p>

                    <h1>Camping Sites</h1>
                    <p>Camping in Sri Lanka can be the best experience you can have while being close to nature. Amidst the scenic jungle location you have a chance to go for rainforest camping which will allow you to get deeply absorbed in the sound of
                        the water being closer to the fall. One can couple the camping expedition with other water activities such as water rafting, bird watching and trekking to waterfalls amongst others. You can have the same concept in a jungle safari
                        too which is an equally thrilling experience.If its hiking/trekking trails or adventure you are interested in, Sri Lanka’s mist covered central mountains in Ella offers marvellous opportunities.</p>
